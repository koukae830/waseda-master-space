This directory contains four examples that illustrate the use 
of the JIPL interface.

draw:		Use Java AWT through the JIPL interface.
queens: 	Solve the 8-queens problem using backtracking.
queens_fc:	solve the n-queens problem using forward checking.
sql:		Use MySQL through the JIPL and JDBC interfaces.

Each example has a separate directory that contains a program 
written in Java, a program written in Prolog, and also a script 
file with the extension name ".bat" that starts the programs. To 
run the sql example, you need to install MySQL and the JDBC driver 
for MySQL named Connector/J, and make sure an SQL server is 
already running.
